# Hospital Management System

A simple Java-based Hospital Management System that allows users to manage patient records. The system supports adding new patients and viewing the list of all patients. This project demonstrates basic object-oriented programming concepts such as encapsulation, lists, and input handling.

## Features

- **Add Patient:** Users can add a new patient by providing their name, age, gender, and illness details.
- **View All Patients:** Displays all the patients currently stored in the system.
- **Exit Program:** Allows the user to exit the program safely.

## Project Structure

The project consists of three main classes:

1. **Patient:** Represents a patient with properties such as `name`, `age`, `gender`, and `illness`.
2. **Hospital:** Manages a list of `Patient` objects and provides methods to add new patients and retrieve the patient list.
3. **HospitalManagementSystem:** Contains the main method, provides a menu-driven interface for adding/viewing patients, and handles input from the user.

## How to Run the Program

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sandeepgoudmacha/Hospital-Managemen-System.git
   cd hospital-Management-System
